# Learning React

This is a first attempt to build a simple SPA app using React and JSX. 
The application provides simple functionality for translating text
using Microsoft Translator API.

The application uses React basics and axios library to make AJAX 
requests. No flux or redux at this point.

In this attempt I separate the data retrieval into a standalone object, 
without utilizing the "container" pattern.
